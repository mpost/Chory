This project contains several different components. Each component is self contained and can be exchanged if required

h4. Android

The "android projects":https://github.com/mpost/chory/tree/master/android contain the control software to send commands from an android device to an arduino device. We currently support the "Android USB Accessory API":http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/accessory.html but support for other transfer mechanisms can be added.

h4. Arduino

The "Arduino project":https://github.com/mpost/chory/tree/master/arduino contains the firmware for the "arduino platform":http://www.arduino.cc/. This project was developed on an "Arduino Uno":http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno but other arduino version should work just fine.
